Hello my name is Lane Carpenter and I getting a BS in Computer Science at Northeastern State University. In this simple project I will be deconstructing an existing web page and rebuild it. 
After finishing the project I will list out all of the skills I demonstarted in this project. I demonstarted how to use html and css with bootstrap to build a responsive webpage. I was able to build from scratch googles homepage design. I showed how properly place divs and change elements among other things. I feel I showed how this project should be and that I can make responsive websites.
