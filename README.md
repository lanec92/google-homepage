Hello my name is Lane Carpenter and I getting a BS in Computer Science at Northeastern State University. In this simple project I will be deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it. 
After finishing the project I will list out all of the skills I demonstrated in this project. I demonstrated how to use html and css with bootstrap to build a simple webpage. I was able to successfully build googles webpage from scratch with a similar design to the original. I showed how to properly place divs and how to change elements among other things. Thank you for viewing this project I hope you like it.
